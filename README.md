# Underwater Image enhancement and restoration
The novel work that is displayed in this repository was put together by me during my summer internship in 2022. Here, an innovative pipeline is put out in which the image is returned to its original colors and this special pipeline is used to produce the required results. Although this strategy uses older approaches, the pipeline it implements is new and offers a solution to the issue at hand. Working with Andromeida Maritime Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in Noida, India, was a wonderful experience.
